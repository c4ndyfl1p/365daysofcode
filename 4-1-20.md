  #### Inputs from a potentiometer
  
  ```void setup()
  {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  }
  void loop()
  {
int value = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.println(value);
  }
```

9600- baud rate: speed at which arduino and pc will communicate. Sending 9600 bits per second

- I get values of inputs between 0-1023. Why?

  I'm using an analog input and making changed in real time, while arduino is a digital processor and knows only 0s and 1nes. How is then analog converted to digital? By using an ADC. Analog to digital convertor circuit. Every ADC has a resolution. Arduino chip ATMEGA328PU internal ADC has 10 bits resolution which means it can represent an analog value in 10 bit. 2^10 = 1024. Hence 0-1024 values

###### more on adc

ADCs can vary greatly between microcontroller. The ADC on the Arduino is a 10-bit ADC meaning it has the ability to detect 1,024 (2^10) discrete analog levels. Some microcontrollers have 8-bit ADCs (2^8 = 256 discrete levels) and some have 16-bit ADCs (2^16 = 65,536 discrete levels).

The way an ADC works is fairly complex. There are a few different ways to achieve this feat (see Wikipedia [for a list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter#ADC_types)), but one of the most common technique uses the analog voltage to charge up an internal capacitor and then measure the time it takes to discharge across an internal resistor. The microcontroller monitors the number of clock cycles that pass before the capacitor is discharged. This number of cycles is the number that is returned once the ADC is complete.

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int potpin = 0;  // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer
int val;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  val = analogRead(potpin);            // reads the value of the potentiometer (value between 0 and 1023)
  val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180);     // scale it to use it with the servo (value between 0 and 180)
  myservo.write(val);                  // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
  delay(15);                           // waits for the servo to get there
}
